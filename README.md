## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet Connection Issues**
   - Ensure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
   - Check if you're on the correct network

2. **Message Not Sending**
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check if Supabase is properly configured
   - Make sure both sender and recipient addresses are correct

3. **Build Errors**
   - Clear the `.next` directory: `rm -rf .next`
   - Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Database Issues

If you experience issues with Supabase:

1. Verify your environment variables are correctly set
2. Check the Supabase dashboard for any service disruptions
3. Ensure your database tables and policies are properly set up

## Security Considerations

1. All messages are end-to-end encrypted using libsodium
2. Wallet connections are secure and don't expose private keys
3. Row Level Security ensures users can only access their own messages
4. Messages are stored securely in Supabase with proper access controls

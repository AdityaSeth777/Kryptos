## XMTP Server Integration

Kryptos leverages **XMTP** (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) to provide a reliable and scalable messaging infrastructure. Here's how XMTP enhances Kryptos:

- **Layer-3 Messaging Protocol**: XMTP operates as a layer-3 solution, working seamlessly on top of blockchain networks. It decouples messaging logic from on-chain activities, reducing latency and enhancing efficiency.
- **Decentralized Communication**: Messages are securely exchanged between users without a centralized intermediary, preserving privacy and autonomy.
- **Crypto Wallet Integration**: XMTP ties directly into wallet authentication, ensuring that only verified users can send and receive messages, enhancing security.
- **Future-Ready Framework**: XMTP‚Äôs extensibility ensures that Kryptos can easily adopt new blockchain innovations as they emerge.

With XMTP, Kryptos delivers secure, decentralized, and efficient messaging without compromising user experience.
